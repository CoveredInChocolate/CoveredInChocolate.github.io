<h3>Results</h3>

There are two types of infinite sets: countable such as $\N$, and uncountable sets such as $(0,1)$.
By definition, the elements of a set are unique.
<br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 1</div><br />
Every subset of a countable set is countable.<br />
<br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $A$ be countable, with elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots,$ and let $B$ be a subset of $A$.
Among the elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots,$ let $a_{n_1}, a_{n_2},\ldots$ be those in the set $B$.
If the set of numbers $n_1, n_2, \ldots$ has a largest number, then $B$ is finite.
Otherwise $B$ is countable with correspondence $i\leftrightarrow a_{n_i}$.
<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 2</div><br />
The union of a finite or countable number of countable sets $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ is itself countable.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 3</div><br />
Every infinite set has a countable subset.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $M$ be an infinite set and $a_1$ any element of $M$. Being infinite, $M$ contains an element $a_2$
distinct from $a_1$, and element $a_3$ distinct from $a_1$ and $a_2$, and so on. Continuing this process
we get a countable subset
$$
A = \{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n,\ldots\}
$$
of the set $M$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition</div><br />
Two sets $M$ and $N$ are said to be <b>equivalent</b>, $M\sim N$, if there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between the elements of $M$ and $N$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 4</div><br />
Every infinite set is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
According to Theorem 3, any infinite set $M$ contains a countable subset:
$$
A = \{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n,\ldots\},
$$
and partition $A$ into two countable subsets.
$$
A_1 = \{a_1, a_3, a_5, \ldots\},
\quad
A_2 = \{a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots\}.
$$
Obviously, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the countable sets $A$ and $A_1$
with $a_n\leftrightarrow a_{2n-1}$. This correspondence can be extended to a one-to-one correspondence
between the sets $A\cup(M-A) = M$ and $A_1\cup(M-A) = M - A_2$ by simply assigning $x$ itself to
each element $x\in M-A$. But $M-A_2$ is a proper subset of $M$.

<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 5</div><br />
The set of real numbers in the closed unit interval $[0,1]$ is uncountable.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 7</div> <b>Cantor-Bernstein</b><br />
Given two sets $A$ and $B$, suppose $A$ contains a subset $A_1$ equivalent to $B$, while $B$
contains a subset $B_1$ equivalent to $A$. Then $A$ and $B$ are equivalent.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
A set with an uncountable subset is itself uncountable.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
A set $A$ is countable if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements
of $A$ and $\N$, or in other words, if there exists an injective function $f: A\rightarrow \N$.
<br /><br />
Let us call the set $A$ and the subset $S$ and assume $S$ is uncountable. Let us assume for contradiction
that $A$ is countable, so there exists an injective function $f: A\rightarrow \N$. Since $S\subset A$,
we can define the function $g(x) = \{f(x)\;|\; x\in S\}$ which is an injective function $g:S\rightarrow\N$.
But this is impossible since $S$ is uncountable. Hence, $A$ must be uncountable.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
Let $M$ be any infinite set and $A$ any countable set. Prove that $M\sim M\cup A$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Assume first that $M$ is a countable. By Theorem 2, $M\cup A$ is countable, so $M\sim M\cup A$.
<br /><br />
Assume now that $M$ is uncountable. Since $M$ is an uncountable subset of $M\cup A$, then $M\cup A$
is uncountable by Problem 1, so $M\sim M\cup A$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
Prove that the following sets are countable. As shown in Example 4, the set of rational numbers, $\Q$,
is a countable set which we will use.
<br /><br />
a) The set of all numbers with two distinct decimal expansions (like $0.5000\ldots$ and $0.4999\ldots$).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let us call the set of numbers with two distinct decimal expansions $D$.
<br /><br />
Any number with two distinct decimal expansions terminates in an infinite number of 0s, which means
there are a finite number of non-zero decimals. This in turn means that it can be represented as
a fraction and is therefore rational.
<br /><br />
Since there are rational numbers that do not have two distinct decimal expansions, such as
$1/3$ or $4/7$, the set $D$ is a proper subset of $\Q$. By Theorem 4, 
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
b) The set of all rational points in the plane (points with rational coordinates).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
c) The set of all rational intervals (intervals with rational endpoints).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
d) The set of all polynomials with rational coefficients.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
