<h3>Results</h3>

There are two types of infinite sets: countable such as $\N$, and uncountable sets such as $(0,1)$.
By definition, the elements of a set are unique.
<br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 1</div><br />
Every subset of a countable set is countable.<br />
<br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $A$ be countable, with elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots,$ and let $B$ be a subset of $A$.
Among the elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots,$ let $a_{n_1}, a_{n_2},\ldots$ be those in the set $B$.
If the set of numbers $n_1, n_2, \ldots$ has a largest number, then $B$ is finite.
Otherwise $B$ is countable with correspondence $i\leftrightarrow a_{n_i}$.
<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 2</div><br />
The union of a finite or countable number of countable sets $A_1, A_2,\ldots$ is itself countable.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 3</div><br />
Every infinite set has a countable subset.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $M$ be an infinite set and $a_1$ any element of $M$. Being infinite, $M$ contains an element $a_2$
distinct from $a_1$, and element $a_3$ distinct from $a_1$ and $a_2$, and so on. Continuing this process
we get a countable subset
$$
A = \{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n,\ldots\}
$$
of the set $M$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition</div><br />
Two sets $M$ and $N$ are said to be <b>equivalent</b>, $M\sim N$, if there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between the elements of $M$ and $N$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 4</div><br />
Every infinite set is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
According to Theorem 3, any infinite set $M$ contains a countable subset:
$$
A = \{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n,\ldots\},
$$
and partition $A$ into two countable subsets.
$$
A_1 = \{a_1, a_3, a_5, \ldots\},
\quad
A_2 = \{a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots\}.
$$
Obviously, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the countable sets $A$ and $A_1$
with $a_n\leftrightarrow a_{2n-1}$. This correspondence can be extended to a one-to-one correspondence
between the sets $A\cup(M-A) = M$ and $A_1\cup(M-A) = M - A_2$ by simply assigning $x$ itself to
each element $x\in M-A$. But $M-A_2$ is a proper subset of $M$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 5</div><br />
The set of real numbers in the closed unit interval $[0,1]$ is uncountable.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 7</div> <b>Cantor-Bernstein</b><br />
Given two sets $A$ and $B$, suppose $A$ contains a subset $A_1$ equivalent to $B$, while $B$
contains a subset $B_1$ equivalent to $A$. Then $A$ and $B$ are equivalent.

<!-- ########################### PROBLEMS ########################### -->

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
A set with an uncountable subset is itself uncountable.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
A set $A$ is countable if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements
of $A$ and $\N$, or in other words, if there exists an injective function $f: A\rightarrow \N$.
<br /><br />
Let us call the set $A$ and the subset $S$ and assume $S$ is uncountable. Let us assume for contradiction
that $A$ is countable, so there exists an injective function $f: A\rightarrow \N$. Since $S\subset A$,
we can define the function $g(x) = \{f(x)\;|\; x\in S\}$ which is an injective function $g:S\rightarrow\N$.
But this is impossible since $S$ is uncountable. Hence, $A$ must be uncountable.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
<i>Alternative Proof</i>.<br />
The statement we want to prove is: if the set $S\subset A$ is uncountable, then $A$ is uncountable.
<br /><br />
The contrapositive statement is: if $A$ is countable, then $S\subset A$ is a countable. This follows
from Theorem 1. It follows that if $S\subset A$ is uncountable, then $A$ is uncountable.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
Let $M$ be any infinite set and $A$ any countable set. Prove that $M\sim M\cup A$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Assume first that $M$ is a countable. By Theorem 2, $M\cup A$ is countable, so $M\sim M\cup A$.
<br /><br />
Assume now that $M$ is uncountable. Since $M$ is an uncountable subset of $M\cup A$, then $M\cup A$
is uncountable by Problem 1, so $M\sim M\cup A$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
Prove that the following sets are countable. As shown in Example 4, the set of rational numbers $\Q$
is countable.
<br /><br />
a) The set of all numbers with two distinct decimal expansions (like $0.5000\ldots$ and $0.4999\ldots$).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let us call the set of numbers with two distinct decimal expansions $D$.
<br /><br />
Any number with two distinct decimal expansions has a representation that terminates with an infinite
number of 0s, which means there are a finite number of non-zero decimals. This in turn means that it
can be represented as a fraction and is therefore rational.
Since there are rational numbers that do not have two distinct decimal expansions, such as
$1/3$ or $4/7$, the set $D$ is a proper subset of $\Q$. For every $n\in\N$, $n + 1/2 \in D$
so it is an infinite set.
<br /><br />
We assume for contradiction that $D$ is uncountable. Since it is a proper subset of $\Q$, then
by Problem 1, $\Q$ must be uncountable. This is a contradiction, so we conclude that $D$ is a
countable set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
b) The set of all rational points in the plane (points with rational coordinates).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Since $\Q$ is a countable set, we can write $\Q = \{q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots\}$. If we fix $q_1$
we get the following set:
$$
Q_1 = \{(q_1, p)\;|\; p\in\Q\},
$$
which are all rational points in the plane with $q_1$ in the $x$ position. We can create a one-to-one
correspondence with $\Q$ by simply setting $p\leftrightarrow (q_1, p)$ for each $p\in\Q$, which shows
that $Q_1$ is countable. For every $q_i\in\Q$ we define the following sets which are countable by the
same argument.
$$
Q_i = \{(q_i, p)\;|\; p\in\Q\},
$$
We can now define the following union which are all rational points in the plane:
$$
\mathcal{Q} = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty Q_n,
$$
which is a countable union of countable sets. By Theorem 2, $\mathcal{Q}$ is a countable set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
c) The set of all rational intervals (intervals with rational endpoints).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Define $\mathscr{Q}_1$ to be the set of all open intervals with rational endpoints.
$$
\mathscr{Q}_1 = \{(p,q)\;|\; p,q\in\Q\}.
$$
Using $\mathcal{Q}$ from (b), we can create a bijection from $\mathcal{Q}$ to $\mathscr{Q}_1$
by setting $(p,q)\leftrightarrow(p,q)$ which shows that $\mathscr{Q}_1$ is a countable set.
<br /><br />
In a similar way, we can define the following three sets of half-open and closed intervals
$$
\mathscr{Q}_2 = \{[p,q)\;|\; p,q\in\Q\}.
$$
$$
\mathscr{Q}_3 = \{(p,q]\;|\; p,q\in\Q\}.
$$
$$
\mathscr{Q}_4 = \{[p,q]\;|\; p,q\in\Q\}.
$$
which are all countable sets by the same argument as for $\mathscr{Q}_1$. We have
four countable sets, and by Theorem 2 their union is a countable set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
Will use a theorem not mentioned in the book.
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Theorem A.1</div><br />
A finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
d) The set of all polynomials with rational coefficients.<br />
(<b>Note</b>: this has to be the set of
all <i>finite</i> polynomials with rational coefficients, otherwise it isn't true. Will
also try to prove this without cartesian ).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Finite polynomials with rational coefficients are on the following form
$$
p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + p_3x^3 + \ldots + p_nx^n
$$
where $p_i\in\Q$ for all $i$. We define the set of all rational polynomials as follows:
$$
P = \{p_0 + p_1x + \ldots + p_nx^n\;|\; p_0,p_1,\ldots, p_n\in\Q\}
$$
For any rational polynomial, we can create the following bijection.
$$
p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \ldots + p_nx^n \leftrightarrow
(p_0, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)\in\Q\times\Q\times\Q\times\ldots\times\Q = \textbf{Q}^n.
$$
Since $\Q$ is countable and this is a finite cartesian product, then by Theorem A.1,
$\textbf{Q}^n$ is countable. Since we have a bijection between $P$ and $\textbf{Q}^n$,
it follows that $P$ is countable.
<!-- ################# Attempt 2 ################# -->
<!-- Finite polynomials with rational coefficients are on the following form
$$
P = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + p_3x^3 + \ldots + p_nx^n
$$
where $p_i\in\Q$ for all $i$. Let $P_0$ denote the set of all 0th degree polynomials,
i.e. constant rationals.
$$
P_0 = \{p_0\,|\,p_0\in\Q\}
$$
Obviously, $P_0 = \Q$, so it is countable.
<br /><br />
Let $P_1$ denote the set of all first degree polynomials,
$$
P_1 = \{p_0 + p_1\cdot x\;|\; p_0,p_1\in\Q\}.
$$
Similarly to the argument from (b), we fix $p_n\in\Q$, and define the sets
$$
\mathcal{Z}_{n} = \{(p_n, q)\,|\, q\in\Q\}
$$ -->

<!-- ################# Attempt 1 ################# -->
<!-- Polynomials with rational coefficients are on the following form
$$
P = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + p_3x^3 + \ldots
$$
where $p_i\in\Q$ for all $i$. Let $P_0$ denote the set of all rational $p_0$.
Then $P_0 = \Q$ which is countable. If $P_1$ is the set of all rational coefficients
for $x$, then $P_1 = \Q$, which is also countable. For all possible rational coefficients
for a first degree polynomial, $p_0 + xp_1$ we get:
$$
P_0\cup P_1 = \Q\cup\Q 
$$
which is a finite union of countable sets which by Theorem 2 is countable. Continuing this way,
we define $P_k$ to be the set of all rational coefficients associated with $x^k$ and the set of
all possible polynomials coefficients become:
$$
%\{P\,|\, p_i\in\Q\;\text{for all}\;i\} =
\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty P_n
$$
which is a countable union of countable sets, and by Theorem 2 this is countable. -->

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
A number $\alpha$ is said to be <i>algebraic</i> if it is a root of a polynomial equation
with rational coefficients. Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable.
<br /><br />
From the fundamental theorem of algebra, any non-constant, $n$th degree polynomial can be split up into $n$
first degree polynomials. For instance, a second degree polynomial can be factored into
two first degree polynomials:
$$
p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 = r_2(x - r_0)(x - r_1)
$$
where $r_2 = p_2$. The roots $r_0$ and $r_1$ can be irrational or even complex, and they can be
equal to each other, but for our purposes that doesn't matter.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Define $R$ as the set of all roots of polynomials with rational coefficients.
From the fundamental theorem of algebra, non-constant $n$th degree polynomial can be factored into
$n$ first degree polynomials.
$$
p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + p_3x^3 + \ldots + p_nx^n = r_n(x-r_0)(x-r_1)\ldots(x-r_{n-1})
$$
where $p_0,\ldots, p_n\in\Q$ and $r_0,\ldots,r_n\in\C$. Using this, we can create a one-to-one
correspondence from the set of all polynomials $P$, to the set of all roots $R$ as
$$
(q_0, q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n) \leftrightarrow (r_0, r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n).
$$
Since we have a bijection from the countable set $P$ to $R$ and from 3(d) $P$ is countable,
the set $R$ is countable.
