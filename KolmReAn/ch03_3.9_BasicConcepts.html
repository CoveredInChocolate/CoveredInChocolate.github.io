<div class="thm">Definition 1</div><br />
Given a set $X$, a <b>topology</b> in $X$ is a system $\tau$ of subsets $G\subset X$,
called <b>open sets</b> (relative to $\tau$), with the following two properties.<br />
(1) The set $X$ itself and $\emptyset$ belong to $\tau$.<br />
(2) Arbitrary (finite or infinite) unions $\bigcup_\alpha G_\alpha$ and finite intersections
$\bigcap_\alpha G_\alpha$ belong to $\tau$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 2</div><br />
A <b>topological space</b> is a pair $(X,\tau)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a topology $\tau$
defined in $X$.<br />
(In this text, a topological space will usually be called $T = (X,\tau)$).
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Closed Sets</b><br />
The open sets in a topology are specified. Closed sets are the complements of the open sets; $T-G$.
So, $X$ and $\emptyset$ are closed (and open) sets. Closed sets are closed under arbitrary intersections
and finite unions.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Concepts from Metric Spaces</b><br />
(1) A <i>neighborhood</i> of a point $x$ in a topological space $T$ is any open set $G\subset T$ containing $x$.<br />
(2) A point $x\in T$ is called a <i>contact point</i> of a set $M\subset T$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains at
least one point of $M$.<br />
(3) A point $x\in T$ is called a <i>limit point</i> of a set $M\subset T$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains
infinitely many points of $M$.<br />
(4) The set of all contact points of a set $M\subset T$ is called the <i>closure</i> of $M$, and is denoted by $[M]$.<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 1</div><br />
The intersection $\tau = \bigcap_\alpha \tau_\alpha$ of any set of topologies on $X$
is itself a topology in $X$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Corollary</div><br />
Let $\mathscr{B}$ be any system of subsets of a set $X$. Then there exists a minimal topology
containing $\mathscr{B}$, i.e. a topology $\tau(\mathscr{B})$ containing $\mathscr{B}$ and
contained in every topology containing $\mathscr{B}$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 3</div><br />
A family $\mathscr{G}$ of open subsets of a toplogical space $T$ is called a <b>base</b> for
$T$ if every open set in $T$ can be represented as a union of sets in $\mathscr{G}$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 2</div><br />
Given a set $T$, let $\mathscr{G}$ be a system of subsets of $G_\alpha\subset T$ with
the following two properties:<br />
(1) Every point $x\in T$ belongs to at least one $G_\alpha\in \mathscr{G}$.<br />
(2) If $x\in G_\alpha\cap G_\beta$, then there is a $G_\gamma\in\mathscr{G}$ such that
$x\in G_\gamma\subset G_\alpha\cap G_\beta$.
<br /><br />
Suppose that $\emptyset$ and all sets representable as unions of sets $G_\alpha$ are
designated as open. Then $T$ is a toplogical space, and $\mathscr{G}$ is a base for $T$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<i>Useful theorem for determining whether a given system of open sets is a base.</i>
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Theorem 3</div><br />
A system $\mathscr{G}$ of open sets $G_\alpha$ in a topological space $T$ is a base for
$T$ if and only if, given any open set $G\subset T$ and any point $x\in G$, there is a
set $G_\alpha\in\mathscr{G}$ such that $x\in G_\alpha\subset G$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 4</div><br />
If a topological space $T$ has a countable base, then $T$ contains a countable everywhere
dense subset, i.e. a countable set $M\subset T$ such that $[M] = T$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 5</div><br />
If a metric space $R$ has a countable everywhere dense subset, then $R$ has a countable
base.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>First Axiom of Countability</b><br />
Let $x\in X$ be some point. If there exists a coutnable neighborhood base at $x$, i.e. a countable system
$mathscr{O}$ of neighborhoods of $x$ with the following property: Given any open set $G$ containing $x$,
there is a neighborhood $O\in\mathscr{O}$ sich that $O\subset G$. Suppose every point $x$ of a topological
space $T$ has a countable neighborhood base. Then $T$ is said to satisfy the <i>first axiom of countability</i>
(or that it is a first-countable set).
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Covering of Topological Spaces</b><br />
A system $\mathscr{M}$ of sets $M_\alpha$ is called a <i>cover</i> or <i>covering</i> of a topological space $T$,
and $\mathscr{M}$ is said to <i>cover</i> $T$ if,
$$
T = \bigcup_\alpha M_\alpha.
$$
An open (closed) cover consists of open (closed) sets. A subcover is a subset of the covering that also covers $T$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 6</div><br />
If $T$ is a topological space with a countable base $\mathscr{G}$, then every open cover $\mathscr{O}$ has a finite or
countable subcover.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 7</div><br />
If a topological space $T$ satisfies the first axiom of countability, then every contact point of $x$ of a set $M\subset T$
is the limit of a convergenct sequence of points in $M$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<i>General topological spaces are too different from metric spaces. Some additional assumptions makes the resemblance clearer.</i>
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Definition 4</div><br />
Suppose that for each pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $T$, there is a neighborhood $O_x$ of $x$
and a neighborhood $O_y$ of $y$ such that $x\in O_x$ and $y\in O_y$. Then $T$ is said to satisfy the
<b>first axiom of separability</b>, and is called a <b>T<sub>1</sub>-space</b>.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 8</div><br />
Every finite subset of a $T_1$-space is closed.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<i>A stronger seperation axiom; each pair of distinct points has a pair of disjoint neighborhoods.</i>
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Definition 5</div><br />
Suppose that for each pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $T$, there is a neighborhood $O_x$ of $x$
and a neighborhood $O_y$ of $y$ such that $O_x\cap O_y = \emptyset$. Then $T$ is said to satisfy the
<b>second axiom of separability</b>, and is called a <b>T<sub>2</sub>-space</b> or a <b>Hausdorff space</b>.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<i>Spaces more general than Hausdorff are rarely studied. Instead, an even stronger axiom of seperability is used.
All pairs of disjoint closed, sets has a pair of disjoint neighborhoods.</i>
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Definition 6</div><br />
A $T_1$-space $T$ is said to be <b>normal</b> if for each pair of disjoint closed sets $F_1$ and $F_2$ in $T$,
there are open sets $O_1\supset F_1$ and $O_2\supset F_2$ such that $O_1\cap O_2 = \emptyset$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 9</div><br />
Every metric space is normal.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Continuous Mappings</b><br />
Let $f: X\rightarrow Y$ be a mapping between topological spaces, so $f$ associates an element $y = f(x)$ for
each element $x\in X$. Then $f$ is said to be <i>continuous at the point $x_0\in X$</i> if, given any neighborhood
$V_{y_0}$ of the point $y_0 = f(x_0)$, there is a neighborhood $U_{x_0}$ around $x_0$ such that $f(U_{x_0})\subset V_{y_0}$.
The mapping $f$ is said to be <i>continuous on $X$</i> if it is continuous at every point of $X$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 10</div><br />
A mapping $f$ of a topological space $X$ into a topological space $Y$ is continuous if and only if the preimage
$\Gamma = f^{-1}(G)$ of every open set $G\subset Y$ is open in $X$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 10'</div><br />
A mapping $f$ of a topological space $X$ into a topological space $Y$ is continuous if and only if the preimage
$\Gamma = f^{-1}(F)$ of every closed set $F\subset Y$ is closed in $X$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 11</div><br />
Given topologial spaces $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, suppose $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous and $\phi:Y\rightarrow Z$
is continuous. Then the mapping $\phi\circ f = \phi(f(x))$ is continuous.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Homeomorphic Mappings</b><br />
If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $f^{-1}: Y\rightarrow X$ are continuous functions between two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$
then $f$ is called a <i>homeomorphic mapping</i> or just a <i>homeomorphism</i>. The spaces will have the same
topological properties, and are just two different 'representatives' of the same space.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<i>Topological spaces can be introduced by specifying the open sets, specifying a base, or introducing a notion of convergence.
    One of the most important ways is by specifying a metric space in $T$.
</i>
<br /><br />
<div class="thm">Definition 5</div><br />
Suppose that for each pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $T$, there is a neighborhood $O_x$ of $x$
and a neighborhood $O_y$ of $y$ such that $O_x\cap O_y = \emptyset$. Then $T$ is said to satisfy the
<b>second axiom of separability</b>, and is called a <b>T<sub>2</sub>-space</b> or a <b>Hausdorff space</b>.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Urysohn's Metrization Theorem</div><br />
A necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space with a countable base to metrizable is that it be normal.

<!-- ########################### PROBLEMS ########################### -->

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
Given a topological space $T$, prove that a set $G\subset T$ is open if and only if every point of $x\in G$
has a neighborhood contained in $G$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
$\Rightarrow$) Assume $G$ is open. Then for any point $x\in G$, it follows that $x\in G\subset G$ which is a neighborhood.
<br /><br />
$\Leftarrow$) Assume every $x\in G$ has some neighborhood $O$ such that $x\in O\subset G$. By the property of
topologies, the union of all these sets $\bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha$ is open. Our claim is that $\bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha = G$.
<div class="indent">
    $\supset$) Assume $x\in G$, by our assumption, $x\in O\subset G$ so $x\in \bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha$ and so
    $G\subset \bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha$.<br />
    $\subset$) Assume $x\in \bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha$, then for some $\beta$, we have $x\in O_\beta\subset G$ by our assumption.
    It follows that $x\in G$, which means that $\bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha\subset G$.
</div> 
Hence $G = \bigcup_\alpha O_\alpha$ and it is an open set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<b>Closure - Alternative Definition</b><br />
Define the closure of $M$ be the arbitrary intersection of all closed sets containing $M$. That is,
if each $C_\alpha$ is a closed set such that $M\subset C_\alpha$, then
$$
[M] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha.
$$
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<b>Problem</b><br />
Given a topological space $T$, prove the following statements.
<br /><br />
(a) $[M] = M$ if and only if $M$ is a closed set, i.e. the complement $T-G$ of an open set $G\subset T$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
$\Rightarrow$) Assume $[M] = M$. Then, by the alternative definition,
$$
[M] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
M = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha
$$
which is an arbitrary intersection of closed sets, and hence $M$ is closed.
<br /><br />
$\Leftarrow$) Assume $M$ is a closed set. We will show that $[M] = M$.
<div class="indent">
    $\supset$) Let $\overline{M}$ denote the set of contact points. Then $[M] = M\cup\overline{M}$,
    and so $M\subset[M]$.
    <br /><br />
    $\subset$) Since $M$ is closed, then $M = C_\beta$ is a closed set containing $M$, so
    $$
    [M] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha \subset M
    \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
    [M] \subset M.
    $$
    By inclusion both ways, $[M] = M$.
</div>
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
(b) $[M]$ is the smallest closed set containing $M$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $C$ be any closed set such that $M\subset C$, then
$$
[M] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha \subset C
$$
which shows that $[M]\subset C$. So $[M]$ is the smallest closed set containing $M$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
(c) The closure operator, i.e. the mapping of $T$ into $T$ carrying $M$ into $[M]$ satisfies:
<div class="indent">
1) If $M\subset N$ then $[M]\subset[N]$<br />
2) $[[M]] = [M]$<br />
3) $[M\cup N] = [M]\cup[N]$<br />
4) $[\emptyset] = \emptyset$
</div>
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
(1) Assume $M\subset N$, and we will show that $[M]\subset[N]$. By definition of closed sets,
let $C_\alpha$ be the closed sets containing $N$. Then,
$$
[N] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha.
$$
Since $M\subset N$, then $M\subset C_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, so:
$$
M \subset \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha = D_\gamma.
$$
So, $D_\gamma$ is a closed set containing $M$. Again, let $D_\beta$ be the closed sets containing $M$.
By definition of the closure,
$$
[M] = \bigcap_\beta D_\beta = \bigcap_{\beta\not=\gamma}D_\beta\cap D_\gamma \subset D_\gamma = [N].
$$
Therefore, $[M]\subset[N]$.
<br /><br /><br />
(2) Since $[M]$ is a closed set, then by (a), $[[M]] = [M]$. 
<br /><br /><br />
(3)<br />
<div class="indent">
$\subset$) We have that $M\cup N\subset [M]\cup[N]$, which is a closed set containing $M\cup N$ since it is a finite union
of closed sets. So,
$$
[M\cup N] = \bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha \subset [M]\cup[N].
$$
$\supset$) Since $M\subset M\cup N$, it follows from (1) that $[M]\subset [M\cup N]$, and similarly, $[N]\subset[M\cup N]$.
Since both of these are subsets, we can conclude that $[M]\cup[N]\subset[M\cup N]$.
</div><br />
By inclusion both ways, $[M\cup N] = [M]\cup[N]$.
<br /><br /><br />
(4) Since $\emptyset$ is a closed set, then by (a), $[\emptyset] = \emptyset$. 
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
Consider the set $\mathscr{T}$ of all possible topologies defined in a set $X$, where $\tau_1\leq \tau_2$ means that
$\tau_1$ is weaker than $\tau_2$ ($\tau_1\subset\tau_2$). Verify that $\leq$ is a partial ordering of $\mathscr{T}$.
Is there a maximum and minimum element? If so, what are they?
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Verifying the three properties of a partial order.
<br /><br />
(Reflexive). For some topology $\tau$, then obviously, $\tau \subset \tau$, so $\tau\leq\tau$ is true.
<br /><br />
(Transitivity). If $\tau_1\leq \tau_2$ and $\tau_2\leq \tau_3$, we have $\tau_1\subset\tau_2\subset\tau_3$
from which it clearly follows that $\tau_1\subset\tau_3$, and $\tau_1\leq\tau_3$.
<br /><br />
(Antisymmetry). If $\tau_A\leq\tau_B$ and $\tau_B\leq\tau_A$, then they are included in each other, so $\tau_A = \tau_B$
which shows that antisymmetry is satisfied.
<br /><br />
All properties are met, so we can conclude that $\leq$ is a partial ordering on $\mathscr{T}$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
There are minimal and maximum elements. The mimium element is the trivial topology, $\{\emptyset, X\}$ which must be included
in all other topologies. The maximum element is the power set of all possible subsets of $X$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(X)$ which
is a topology, and which contains all other topologies. 
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
Can two distinct topologies, $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ in $X$ generate the same relative topology in a subset $A\subset X$?
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Yes, this is possible. Consider the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$ with the following topologies.
$$
\tau_1 = \{\emptyset, \{b\}, X\},
$$
$$
\tau_2 = \{\emptyset, \{c\}, X\}.
$$
These are distinct topologies. If we set $A = \{a\}$, then the relative topologies become the trivial topology on $A$:
$$
\tau_1\cap A = \{\emptyset, \{a\}\} = \tau_2\cap A.
$$
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
Let
$$
X = \{a,b,c\},\quad A = \{a, b\},\quad B = \{b, c\}
$$
and let $\mathscr{G} = \{\emptyset, X, A, B\}$. Is $\mathscr{G}$ a base for a topology in $X$?
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Note that $A\cap B = \{b\}$ and that there is no open set containing $b$ that is a subset of $A\cap B$.
This breaks with the second property of Theorem 2, so $\mathscr{G}$ is NOT a valid base for a topology. 
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
Prove that if $M$ is an uncountable subset of a topological space with a countable base, then some point of $M$
