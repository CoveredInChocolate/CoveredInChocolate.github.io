<h3>Results</h3>

<div class="thm">Heine-Borel Theorem</div><br />
Any cover of a closed interval $[a, b]$ by a system of open interval (or, open sets) has a finite subcover.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Example</b><br />
In the following, $C$ is a cover of $X$, since it's union contains $X$. $U$ is a subcover of $C$, since $U\subset C$.
$$X=\{1,2,3\}$$
$$C=\{\{1\},\{2\},\{1,3\}\}$$
$$U=\{\{2\},\{1,3\}\}$$

<div class="thm">Theorem 1</div><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 3</div><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 8</div><br />
Each of the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient for a topological space $T$ to be countably compact.

    1) Every countable open cover of $T$ has a finite subcover.<br />
    2) Every countable centered system of closed subsets of $T$ has a nonempty intersection.

<br /><br />


<b>Important Distinction</b><br />
A compact topological space are those where an <i>arbitrary</i> open cover have a finite subcover, and the countably compact spaces
where a <i>countable</i> open cover has a finite subcover. The following Theorem shows the special case where the first implies the second.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<div class="thm">Theorem 9</div><br />
The concepts of compactness and countable compactness coincide for a topological space $T$ with a countable base.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<div class="thm">Definition 4</div><br />
A subset $M$ of a topological space $T$ is said to be <b>relatively compact</b> (in $T$) if its closure $\overline{M}$
in $T$ is compact.
<br /><br /><br /><br />


<div class="thm">Definition 5</div><br />
A subset $M$ of a topological space $T$ is said to be <b>relatively countably compact</b> (in $T$) if every infinite subset
$A\subset M$ has at least one limit point in $T$ (which may not belong to $T$).

<!-- ########################### PROBLEMS ########################### -->

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<i>Skipped... (Uninteresting counterexample)</i>
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
A topological space $T$ is said to be <i>locally compact</i> if every point $x\in T$ has at least one relatively compact
neighborhood. Show that a compact space is automatically locally compact, but not conversely. Prove that every closed
subspace of a locally compact subspace is locally compact.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Suppose $T$ is a compact space and let $x$ be some arbitrary point in $T$. Then select some open neighborhood containing $x$, $U\ni x$.
The closure $[U]$ is a closed subset of a compact space. By Theorem 2, $[U]$ will be a compact
space, so $U$ is a relatively compact neighborhood. This shows that $T$ is locally compact.
<br /><br />
Now a counterexample to show that the converse is not true; a space can be locally compact; i.e. every point has a neighborhood
whose closure is compact. But that the space is not compact; an open cover does NOT have a finite subcover. An example of this
is simply $\R$, which is locally compact, but not compact. Every $x\in\R$ is contained in an open set $(a, b)$ where the
closure $[a, b]$ is compact, but there is no finite subcover of $\R$.
<br /><br />
Suppose $K$ is a locally compact subspace of $T$, and let $F$ be a closed subspace of $K$. Let $x$ be a random point $x\in F$.
Then $x\in K$ and since $K$ is locally compact, there is at least one neighborhood $U_x\ni x$ such that $[U_x]$ is compact with
respect to $K$. Let $[V_x] = [U_x]\cap F$, then $[V_x]\subset [U_x]$ is a closed subset of a compact space $[U_x]$ and by
Theorem 2, $[V_x]$ is compact. But then $V_x$ is a relatively compact neighborhood of $x$ so $F$ is locally compact.

<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
A point $x$ is said to be a <i>complete limit point</i> of a subset $A$ of a topological space, if given any neighborhood
$U\ni x$, the sets $A$ and $A\cap U$ have the power (i.e. cardinal number). Prove that every infinite subset of a compact space $T$
has at least one complete limit point.
