<b>Open Ball</b><br />
An open sphere/ball $S(x_0, r)$ is the set of points $x\in X$ satisfying the inequality:
$$
\rho(x_0, x) < r.
$$
where $\rho$ is a metric. The fixed point $x_0$ is the center of the sphere, and $r$ is the radius.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Closed Ball</b><br />
An closed sphere/ball $S[x_0, r]$ is the set of points $x\in X$ satisfying the inequality:
$$
\rho(x_0, x) \leq r.
$$
where $\rho$ is a metric. The fixed point $x_0$ is the center of the sphere, and $r$ is the radius.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Contact Point and Closure</b><br />
A point $x\in X$ is a contact point for a set $M\subset X$ if every neighborhood of $x$ (epsilon-ball around $x$)
contains at least one point of $M$. (For instance, the point 1 is a contact point for $(0,1)$).
<br /><br />
The set of all contact points is called the closure of $M$ and denoted by $[M]$. For instance, $[(0,1)] = [0,1]$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 1</div><br />
The closure operator $[\cdot]$ has the following properties:
<br /><br />
1) If $M\subset N$ then $[M]\subset[N]$<br />
2) $[[M]] = [M]$<br />
3) $[M\cup N] = [M]\cup[N]$<br />
4) $[\emptyset] = \emptyset$
<!-- <br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
1) This is obvious.
<br /><br />
2) Let $x\in[[M]]$. Then any given neighborhood $O_\eps(x)$ contains a point $x_1\in[M]$. Consider the sphere
$O_{\eps_1}(x_1)$ of radius:
$$
\eps_1 = \eps - \rho(x, x_1).
$$
Clearly, $O_{\eps_1}$ is contained in $O_\eps(x)$. In fact, if $z\in O_{\eps_1}$ then $\rho(z, x_1)<\eps_1$
and hence, since $\rho(x, x_1) = \eps-\eps_1$, it follows from the triangle inequality that
$$
\rho(z, x) < \eps_1 + (\eps - \eps_1) = \eps,
$$
i.e., $z\in O_\eps(x)$.

<b>Convergence</b><br />
A sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a metric space converges to a point $x\in X$ if every neighborhood $O_\eps(x)$
contains all points of the sequence after some $N\in\N$. The point $x$ is called the limit of the
sequence $\{x_n\}$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 2</div><br />
A necessary and sufficient condition for a point $x$ to be a contact point of a set $M$ is that there
exist a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of points of $M$ converging to $x$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 2'</div><br />
A necessary and sufficient condition for a point $x$ to be a limit point of a set $M$ is that there
exist a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of distinct points of $M$ converging to $x$.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Dense subset</b><br />
Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of $X$. $A$ is dense in $B$ if $[A]\supset B$. And $A$ is said to be
dense everywhere if $[A] = X$.<br />
(Example: $\Q$ is dense everywhere in $\R$.)
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition</div><br />
A metric space is said to be <b>separable</b> if it has a countable everywhere dense subset.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Closed Sets</b><br />
A subset $M$ of a metric space $(X,\rho)$ is <i>closed</i> if it coincides with its own closure,
that is, $[M] = M$. Or in other words, it is closed if it contains all it's limit points.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 3</div><br />
The intersection of an arbitrary number of closed sets is closed. The union of a <b>finite</b> number of
closed sets is closed.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<b>Open Sets</b><br />
A point $x$ is called an interior point of a set $M$ if $x$ has a neighborhood $O_\eps(x)\subset M$, i.e.
it has a neighborhood consisting entirely of points of $M$. A set is said to be <i>open</i> if all its
points are interior points.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 4</div><br />
A subset $M$ of a metric space $(X, \rho)$ is open if and only if its complement $X-M$ is closed.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Corollary</div><br />
The empty set $\emptyset$ and the whole space $X$ are open sets. (Note: they also satisfy the conditions
for being closed sets, so they are both).
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 5</div><br />
The union of an arbitrary number of open sets is open. The intersection of a <b>finite</b> number of open sets is open.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 6</div><br />
Every open set $G$ on the real line is the union of a finite or countable system of pairwise disjoint open intervals.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Corollary</div><br />
Every closed set on the real line can be obtained by deleting a finite or coutnable system of pairwise disjoint
intervals from the line.

<b>Continuity</b><br />
Let $f$ be a mapping from $X$ to $Y$ (metric spaces). The function $f$ is continuous if for all $\eps > 0$ there exists
some $\delta > 0$ such that
$$
\rho(x_0, x) < \delta
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\rho'(f(x_0), f(x)) < \eps.
$$
<i>Informally</i>: Whenever we select an $x$ from within the $\delta$-ball in $X$, the mapping will lie inside the
$\eps$-ball in $Y$. Here is an illustration.

<!-- ########################### PROBLEMS ########################### -->

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
Give an example of a metric space $(X, \rho)$ and two open spheres $S(x, r_1)$ and $S(y, r_2)$ in $X$ such
that $S(x,r_1)\subset S(y, r_2)$ although $r_1 > r_2$.
<br /><br />
<i>Solution</i>.<br />
Let $X = U(1)\subset\R^2$ where $U(1)$ denotes the unit circle, i.e. the set $\{(x,y)\in\R\,|\, x^2 + y^2 < 1\}$.
The distance is the standard Euclidean metric:
$$
\rho(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$
Now, select two points $x = y = (0,0)$, and set $r_1 = 2$ and $r_2 = 1$. Then $r_1 > r_2$, but
$S(x,r_1)\subset S(y, r_2)$. (The sets are restricted to a subspace, and in that subspace they are the same).
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
Prove that every contact point of a set $M$ is either a limit point of $M$ or an isolated point of $M$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
By Theorem 2, for some contact point $y$ for $M$, there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of points in $M$ that
converges to $y$. By the definition of convergence, for every epsilon-ball $O_\eps(y)$ there is some $N\in\N$
such that all points in $\{x_n\}$ after $x_N$ lie inside $O_\eps(y)$. There are two exhaustive possibilities,<br />
1) Every $O_\eps(y)$ contains a single point, in which case $y$ is an isolated point.<br />
2) Every $O_\eps(y)$ contains an infinite amount of points, in which case $y$ is a limit point.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
Prove that if $x_n\rightarrow x$ and $y_n\rightarrow y$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$, then
$\rho(x_n, y_n)\rightarrow\rho(x, y)$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Using the identity from Problem 1 in section 2.5:
$$
|\rho(x, z) - \rho(y, u)| \leq \rho(x, y) + \rho(z, u).
$$
In our case, we set $x = x_n$, $z = y_n$, $y = x$ and $u = y$:
$$
|\rho(x_n, y_n) - \rho(x, y)| \leq \rho(x_n, x) + \rho(y_n, y).
$$
Taking the limit:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|\rho(x_n, y_n) - \rho(x, y)| \leq \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \Big(\rho(x_n, x) + \rho(y_n, y)\Big) = 0
$$
Which leaves us with:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|\rho(x_n, y_n) - \rho(x, y)| \leq 0
$$
which means $\rho(x_n, y_n)\rightarrow\rho(x, y)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
Let $f$ be a mapping from one metric $(X,\rho)$ space to another $(Y,\rho')$, $f: X\rightarrow Y$. Prove that $f$ is continuous at a point $x_0$
if and only if the sequence $\{y_n\} = \{f(x_n)\}$ converges to $y = f(x_0)$ when $x_n\rightarrow x_0$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Showing implication both ways.
<br /><br />
$\Rightarrow$) Assume $f$ is continuous at $x_0$: for any $\eps>0$ there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that
$\rho'(f(x), f(x_0)) < \eps$ when $\rho(x, x_0) < \delta$. Now we assume that $x_n\rightarrow x$, so for every $\eps > 0$
there exists some $N\in\N$ such that $\rho(x_n, x_0) < \eps$ when $n\geq N$.
<br /><br />
$\Leftarrow$) Assume that $x_n\rightarrow x_0$ and that $f(x_n)\rightarrow f(x_0)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. By the definition
of convergence, then for any $\eps > 0$ we can find some $N_1\in\N$ such that $\rho(x_n, x_0) < \eps$ for all $n\geq N_1$.
By assumption we can also find some $N_2\in\N$ such that $\rho'(f(x_n), f(x_0)) < \eps$ whenever $n\geq N_2$. Now, set $\delta = \eps$.
Then, for any $\rho(x, x_0) < \delta$, then $\rho'(f(x_n), f(x_0)) < \eps$, which shows that $f$ is continuous on $x_0$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
Prove the statements.
<br /><br />
a) The closure of any set $M$ is closed.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Any closed set coincides with its closure, and since by Theorem 1, $[[M]] = [M]$, then $[M]$ is a closed set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
b) $[M]$ is the smallest closed set containing $M$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Assume $M$ is a closed set. Then $[M] = M$ which obviously is the smallest set containing $M$.
<br /><br />
Now assume that $M$ is an open set. Let $C$ be some arbitrary closed set such that $M\subset C$. Assume $y\in[M]$,
then it is a limit point for $M$. Since $M\subset C$ and a closed set contains all its limit points, it follows that
$y\in C$, which shows that $[M]\subset C$. Since any closed set $C$ containing $M$ also contains $[M]$, it shows that
$[M]$ is the smallest closed set.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
Is the union of infinitely many closed sets necessarily closed? How about the intersection of infinitely many
open sets? Give examples.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
The countable union of closed sets can be an open set, as shown in Problem 7, in section 1.1.
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left[a + \frac{1}{n}, b - \frac{1}{n}\right] = (a, b)
$$
And the countable intersection of open sets can be a closed sets, also shown in Problem 7.
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left(a - \frac{1}{n}, b + \frac{1}{n}\right) = [a, b]
$$
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
Prove directly that the point 1/4 belongs to the Cantor set, $F$, although it is not an end point of any of the open
intervals deleted in constructing $F$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
As noted in the text, any $x\in[0,1]$ can be written in ternary notation:
$$
x = \frac{a_1}{3} + \frac{a_2}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac{a_2}{3^n} + \ldots,
$$
where $a_i$ can only take values $0, 1, 2$. The $x$ belongs to $F$ if and only if none of the $a_i$ equals 1.
If write 1/4 in this form it becomes:
$$
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{0}{3} + \frac{2}{3^2} + \frac{0}{3^3} + \frac{2}{3^4} + \frac{0}{3^5} + \frac{2}{3^6}  + \ldots,
$$
or in decimal form:
$$
\frac{1}{4} = 0.0202020202\ldots
$$
Since there are no 1s, this shows that $1/4\in F$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 8</h3>
Let $F$ be the Cantor set. Prove the following.
<br /><br />
(a) The points of the first kind;
$$
0, 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, \frac{7}{9}, \frac{8}{9},\ldots
$$
form an everywhere dense subset of $F$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(b) The numbers of the form $t_1 + t_2$, where $t_1,t_2\in F$, fill the whole interval $[0,2]$. 
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 9</h3>
Given a metric space $(X,\rho)$, let $A\subset X$ and $x\in X$. Then the number
$$
\rho(A, x) = \inf_{a\in A}\rho(a, x)
$$
is called the <i>distance between $A$ and $x$</i>. Prove the following statements:
<br /><br />
(a) $x\in A$ implies $\rho(A, x) = 0$, but not conversely.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Assume $x\in A$. Since the distance is nonnegative, $\inf_{a\in A}\rho(a, x)\geq 0$
then $a = x$ so $\inf_{a\in A}\rho(a, x) = \rho(x, x) = 0$.
<br /><br />
To show that the converse is not true consider the following counterexample.
Let $X = \R$, let $A = (0,1)$ and let $x = 1$. Then $x\not\in A$, but
for any $\eps > 0$ we can find some $a\in A$ such that $|a - 1| < \eps$, which means $\inf_{a\in A}\rho(a, x) = 0$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(b) $\rho(A, x)$ is a continuous function of $x$ (for fixed $A$).
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(c) $\rho(A, x) = 0$ if and only if $x$ is a contact point of $A$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
$\Rightarrow$) Assume $\rho(A, x) = 0$. Then for any $\eps > 0$, the point $O_\eps(x)$ will contain points
in $A$ and is therefore a contact point of $A$.
<br /><br />
$\Leftarrow$) Assume $x\in A$ is a contact point. Assume further that $A$ is closed.
Then $x\in A$, since a closed point contains all its contact points. Then by (a),
the distance from $A$ to $x$ is 0. Assume now that $A$ is open. Let $x$ be a contact point. By definition,
for any $\eps > 0$ the ball $O_\eps(x)$ will contain points from $A$, so $\rho(A, x) < \eps$. Since
this is true for any $\eps > 0$, this means that $\rho(A, x) = 0$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(d) $[A] = A\cup M$, where $M$ is the set of all points $x$ such that $\rho(A, x) = 0$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
$\subset$) Assume $x\in[A]$. Since $[A]$ is closed it contains all its contact points, so $\rho(A, x) = 0$,
which means $x\in M \subset A\cup M$. Hence $[A]\subset A\cup M$.
<br /><br />
$\supset$) Assume $x\in A$. Since $A\subset[A]$ then $x\in [A]$. Assume now that $x\in M$ and $x\not\in A$.
Then by definition of $M$, $\rho(A, x) = 0$ which means $x$ is a contact point for $A$ by (c), which also
means $x\in[A]$. It follows that $A\cup M\subset[A]$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 10</h3>
Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of a metric space $(X,\rho)$. Then the number
$$
\rho(A, B) = \inf_{a\in A, b\in B}\rho(a, b)
$$
is called the <i>distance between $A$ and $B$</i>. Show that $\rho(A, B) = 0$ if $A\cap B\not=\emptyset$,
but not conversely.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
Let $x\in A\cap B$. Then by 9(a), $\rho(x, A) = 0$ and $\rho(x, B) = \rho(B, x) = 0$. From the triangle
inequality, $\rho(A, B) \leq \rho(A, x) + \rho(x, B) = 0 + 0 = 0$ which shows that $\rho(A, B) = 0$.
<br /><br />
Showing that the converse is not true with a counterexample.
Let $X = \R$, let $A = (0,1)$ and let $B = [1, 2)$. Then as shown above, $\rho(A, 1) = 0$
and since $1\in B$, $\rho(A, B) = 0$.
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />

<h3>Problem 11</h3>
et $M_K$ be the set of all functions $f$ in $C_{[a,b]}$ satisfying a <i>Lipschitz condition</i>, i.e.
the set of all $f$ such that
$$
|f(t_1) - f(t_2)| < K|t_1 - t_2|
$$
for all $t_1,t_2\in[a,b]$, where $K$ is a fixed positive number. Prove the following statements.
<br /><br />
(a) $M_K$ is closed and in fact is the closure of the set of all differentiable functions on $[a,b]$
such that $|f'(t)| < K$.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(b) The set
$$
M = \bigcup_K M_K
$$
of all functions satisfying the Lipschitz condition for some $K$ is not closed.
<br /><br />
<i>Proof</i>.<br />
<div class="proofend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />
(c) The closure of $M$ is the whole space $C_{[a,b]}$.
