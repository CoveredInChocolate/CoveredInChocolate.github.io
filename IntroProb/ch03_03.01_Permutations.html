<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
Four people are to be arranged in a row to have their picture taken. In how
many ways can this be done?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
The first position can be filled by 4 people, the next by 3 and so on.
There are 4! = 4·3·2·1 = 24 possibilities.
<br /><br />

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
An automobile manufacturer has four colors available for automobile exteri-
ors and three for interiors. How many different color combinations can he
produce?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Using the counting technique, there are a total of 4·3 = 12 color combinations.

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
In a digital computer, a bit is one of the integers {0,1}, and a word is any
string of 32 bits. How many different words are possible?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
There are 2·2·2·...·2 a total of 32 times, or 2<sup>32</sup> = 4294967296. So, quite a few!

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
What is the probability that at least 2 of the presidents of the United States
have died on the same day of the year? If you bet this has happened, would
you win your bet?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
As this is written, there have been a total of 46 presidents. This is the same exact problem as the
shared birthday problem, when we assume that all days are equally likely and we disregard leap years.
The calculation:<br />
<pre class="rcode">
> 1 - prod(365:(365 - 46 + 1))/365**46
[1] 0.9482528
</pre>
so there is a very high probability that at least two presidents have a shared death date.
<br /><br />
This has actually happened, the second and third presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
both died on the same day - actually on the 4th of July!

<h3>Exercise 5</h3>
There are three different routes connecting city A to city B. How many ways
can a round trip be made from A to B and back? How many ways if it is
desired to take a different route on the way back?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
There are 3 routes from A to B, and then 3 routes from B to A, so there are
3·3 = 9 possible round trips. If the way back must be different, it becomes 3·2 = 6 possible trips.

<h3>Exercise 7</h3>
Five people get on an elevator that stops at five floors. Assuming that each
has an equal probability of going to any one floor, find the probability that
they all get off at different floors.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Consider first the case where there are two people in the elevator and there are two floors.
We can make a tree and map out four possible outcomes, each with a probability of 1/4. There are
two ways for the passengers to get off on the same floor, so the probability is 2·(1/2<sup>2</sup>) = 1/2.
<br /><br />
If there are 3 people in the elevator with 3 floors, we get a tree with 27 final outcomes, each
with 1/27. Now there are 3 ways that the passengers can exit on the same floor, so the
probability becomes 3·(1/3<sup>3</sup>) = 1/3<sup>2</sup> = 1/9.
<br /><br />
We can see the pattern, so for 5 people, we get 5·(1/5<sup>5</sup>) = 1/5<sup>4</sup> = 1/625.
<br /><br />
<b>However</b> - that's not what the question was. We want to find the probability of the passengers
getting off at DIFFERENT floors.

<h3>Exercise 8</h3>
A finite set $\Omega$ has $n$ elements. Show that if we count the empty set and $\Omega$
as subsets, there are 2<sup>n</sup> subsets of $\Omega$.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
We can represent each possible subset as a binary number. So<br />
000...0 is the empty set.<br />
111...1 is the full set.<br />
011...0 is some subset.<br />
Each element has 2 possibilities, so we get 2·2·2·...·2 n times, or 2<sup>n</sup> total possibilities.
<br /><br />
<div class="exend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />






<h3>Exercise 9</h3>
A more refined inequality for approximating n! is given by
$$
\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^2 e^{1/(12n + 1)} < n! < \sqrt{2\pi}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^2 e^{1/(12n)} 
$$
Write a computer program to illustrate this inequality for n = 1 to 9.

<h3>Exercise 10</h3>
A deck of ordinary cards is shuffled and 13 cards are dealt. What is the
probability that the last card dealt is an ace?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Simplified cases: if we simply draw an ace from one card: 4/52 = 0.07692308.
<br /><br />
Let us draw two cards. The value of the first card isn't irrelevant,
because if it is an ace, it will affect the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw.
There are two possibilities:<br />
Draw two aces: 4/52·3/51 and drawing one ace: 48/52·4/51. When adding them, we get
0.004524887 + 0.07239819 = 0.07692308.
<br /><br />
Similarly when drawing three cards.<br />
4/52·3/51·2/50 + 4/52·48/51·3/50 + 48/52·4/51·3/50 + 48/52·47/51·4/50 = 0.07692308
<br /><br />
The probability doesn't change even if we change the number of cards. The reason is that
it doesn't matter what draw we use, since it is equally likely to be an ace as any of the other
cads - so the probability is simply 4/52 = 1/13.

<h3>Exercise 11</h3>
There are n applicants for the director of computing. The applicants are interviewed
independently by each member of the three-person search committee
and ranked from 1 to n. A candidate will be hired if he or she is ranked first
by at least two of the three interviewers. Find the probability that a candidate
will be accepted if the members of the committee really have no ability at all
to judge the candidates and just rank the candidates randomly. In particular,
compare this probability for the case of three candidates and the case of ten
candidates.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Assume first there are two interviewers and three candidates. If the first interviewer selects candidate 1,
then there is a 1/3 probability that the second interviewer will do the same.
<br /><br />
Increase to three interviewers and three candidates. If the first interviewer selects candidate 1,
then there are three possible ways of selecting a candidate. Interviewer 2 selects 1, Interviewer 3
selects another. The reverse situation. All interviewers select candidate 1. And finally, the two other
candidates select the same candidate. All cases must be taken into account.
<br /><br />
So in the general case. The first interviewer selects some candidate.
There are four cases that must be considered for selecting a candidate,
 an event which we call S:<br />
Interviewer 2 selects the same candidate, interviewer 3 selects another.<br />
Interviewer 3 selects the same and interviewer 2 selects another.<br />
Both the other interviewers select the same candidate as interviewer 1.<br />
The two other candidates select the same - other - candidate, which can happen in n-1 ways.<br />
So the probability P(S) becomes:
$$
P(S) =
\frac{1}{n}\cdot\frac{n-1}{n} + \frac{n-1}{n}\cdot\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n}\cdot\frac{1}{n} + (n-1)\frac{1}{n^2}
=
\frac{n-1}{n^2} + \frac{n-1}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n^2} + \frac{n-1}{n^2} 
=
\frac{3n-2}{n^2}
$$
Alternatively, the complement event is that all interviewers select different candidates.
\begin{align}
P(S) &= 1 - P(S^c) \\
&= 1 - (1)\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)\left(\frac{n-2}{n}\right) \\
&= \frac{n^2}{n^2} - \frac{n^2 - 3n + 2}{n^2} \\
&= \frac{n^2 - n^2 + 3n - 2}{n^2} \\
&= \frac{3n - 2}{n^2} 
\end{align}
This has been verified by a simulation.
<br /><br />
If there are 3 candidates, we can calculate an explicit probability:
$$
P(S) = \frac{3(3) - 2}{(3)^2}  = \frac{7}{9}
$$
If there are 10 candidates:
$$
P(S) = \frac{3(10) - 2}{(10)^2}  = \frac{28}{100}
$$

<h3>Exercise 12</h3>
A symphony orchestra has in its repertoire 30 Haydn symphonies, 15 modern

symphony followed by a modern work, and then a Beethoven symphony.
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> How many different programs can it play?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> How many different programs are there if the three pieces can be played
in any order?
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b>  How many different three-piece programs are there if more than one
piece from the same category can be played and they can be played in
any order?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
This is a standard application of the counting technique. There are 30·15·9 = 4050
different possible concerts.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
We add all possible orders, which are 3·2·1 = 6 in total. So now there are 6·30·15·9 = 24 300
possible concerts.
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b><br />
There are a total of 54 pieces, and they will play three pieces: 54<sup>3</sup> = 157 464 possible concerts.

<b>(a)</b> if the numbers must come before the letters?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> if there is no restriction on where the letters and numbers appear?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<b>(a)</b> <br />
The numbers can be from 0-9, so 10 possible values, and the letters have 26 possible values.
The total number of possible license plates are: 10·10·10·26·26·26 = 17 576 000 possible license plates.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
There are a total of 36 alphanumeric characters. Now the total number of possible values are:

<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> How many combinations are possible if every button must be used once?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> Assume that the lock can also have combinations that require you to
push two buttons simultaneously and then the other three one at a time.
How many more combinations does this permit?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
First number has 5 possible values, then 4 etc. so this is a factorial problem. There are 5! = 720 possible
combinations.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
For pressing two buttons at the same time, we get 5·4 = 20 possible values. And then we get 3 values afterwards,

<h3>Exercise 15</h3>
A computing center has 3 processors that receive n jobs, with the jobs assigned
to the processors purely at random so that all of the 3<sup>n</sup> possible assignments
are equally likely. Find the probability that exactly one processor has no jobs.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
In this setup, the jobs can be queued. Simplifying the exercise to two jobs, N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>,
and start by finding the probability that all jobs go to either the second or third processor. This can be
summarized in the following image, where the processors are drawn as nodes and the jobs marked by their names.
There are four possible outcomes:
<br /><br />
<img src="img/chapter03/03.01_Ex15_01.png" />
<br /><br />
The probability that the jobs end up in the other processors is:
$$
P(C_1^c) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}
$$
But we must take away the probabilities when both jobs end up in the same processor (which can happen in two ways),
since we want to find the probability that exactly one processor is empty. Denote this event as $C_1^S$.
$$
P(C_1^S) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} - \frac{2}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
$$
This can happen to all three processors, so in the simplified case, this becomes:
$$
P(C_1^S) + P(C_2^S)  + P(C_3^S) = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
$$
<br /><br />
Generalizing to the case with n jobs. The event where exactly one processor has no jobs is S.
$$
P(S) = 3\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n - 2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n\right]

<h3>Exercise 16</h3>
Prove that at least two people in Atlanta, Georgia, have the same initials,
assuming no one has more than four initials.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
The population of Atlanta is about 500 000. If we assume that all people have four initials, there
are a total of 26<sup>4</sup> = 456 976 possible initials. Since this is less than the population,
there must be some repetition, so some people must have the same initials.

<h3>Exercise 17</h3>
Find a formula for the probability that among a set of n people, at least two
have their birthdays in the same month of the year (assuming the months are
equally likely for birthdays.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
In the case where n = 2, the first person can have birthday in any month, and the event that
the second person has a different birthday month, P(D<sub>2</sub>) = 11/12. So the probability
they have the same birthday, P(S<sub>2</sub>) = 1 - 11/12.
<br /><br />
In the case where n = 3, it becomes.
$$
P(D_3) = \left(\frac{11}{12}\right)\left(\frac{10}{12}\right)
$$
$$
P(S_3) = 1 - \left(\frac{11}{12}\right)\left(\frac{10}{12}\right)
$$
and so on. Generalizing to the nth case, adding 12/12 = 1 and assuming n < 13:
$$
P(D_n) = \left(\frac{12}{12}\right)\left(\frac{11}{12}\right)\cdots\left(\frac{12-n+1}{12}\right) = \frac{12!}{(12-n)!}\cdot\frac{1}{12^n}
$$
$$
P(S_n) = 1 - \frac{12!}{(12-n)!12^{n}}.

<h3>Exercise 18</h3>
Consider the problem of finding the probability of more than one coincidence
of birthdays in a group of n people. These include, for example, three people
with the same birthday, or two pairs of people with the same birthday, or
larger coincidences. Show how you could compute this probability, and write
a computer program to carry out this computation. Use your program to find
the smallest number of people for which it would be a favorable bet that there
would be more than one coincidence of birthdays.
