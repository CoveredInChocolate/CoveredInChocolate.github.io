<div class="thm">Conditional Probability</div><br />
We call P(F|E) the <i>conditional probability of F given E</i>, and compute it using the formula
$$
P(F|E) = \frac{P(F\cap E)}{P(E)}.
$$
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 4.1</div><br />
Le E and F be two events. We say that they are <i>independent</i> if
both events have positive probability and,
$$
P(E|F) = E \;\;\text{and}\;\; P(F|E) = P(F).
$$
(Or at least one of the events has probability 0 or 1).
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Theorem 4.1</div><br />
Two events E and F are independent if and only if
$$
P(E\cap F) = P(E)P(F).
$$
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 4.2</div><br />
A set of events A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> are said to
be <i>mutually independent</i> if for any subset
{A<sub>i</sub>, A<sub>j</sub>, ..., A<sub>m</sub>}, we have
$$
P(A_i\cap A_j\cap\ldots\cap A_m) = P(A_i)P(A_j)\cdots P(A_m),
$$
or equivalently, if for any sequence A<sup>c</sup><sub>1</sub>, A<sup>c</sup><sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sup>c</sup><sub>n</sub>
with A<sup>c</sup><sub>j</sub> = A<sub>j</sub> 
$$
P(A_i^c\cap A_j^c\cap\ldots\cap A^c_m) = P(A_i^c)P(A_j^c)\cdots P(A_m^c).
$$
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 4.3</div><br />
Let X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub> be random variables associated with an experiment. Suppose
that the sample space of X<sub>i</sub> is the set R<sub>i</sub>. Then the joint random variable
<span style="text-decoration:overline">X</span> = (X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>)
is defined to be the random variable whose outcomes consist of ordered n-tuples of outcomes, with the
<i>i</i>th coordinate lying in the set R<sub>i</sub>. The sample space Ω of <span style="text-decoration:overline">X</span>
is the cartesian product of the sets R<sub>i</sub>:
$$
\Omega = R_1\times R_2\times \ldots \times R_n.
$$
The joint distribution function of <span style="text-decoration:overline">X</span> is the function which gives the
probability of each of the outcomes of <span style="text-decoration:overline">X</span>.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="thm">Definition 4.4</div><br />
The random variables X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub> are said to be <i>mutually independent</i>
if
$$
P(X_1 = r_1, \ldots, X_n = r_n) = 
P(X_1 = r_1)\cdots P(X_n = r_n)
$$
for any choice of $r_1, \ldots, r_n$. Thus if X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub> are 
mutually independent, then the joint distribution function of the random variable
$$
\overline{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)
$$
is just the product of the individual distribution functions. When two random variables are mutually independent,
we shall say more briefly that they are <i>independent</i>.

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
Assume E and F are two events with positive probabilities. Show that
if P(E|F) = P(E), then P(F|E) = P(F).
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
By assumption and definition of the conditional probability.
$$
P(E) = P(E|F) = \frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
P(E)P(F) = P(E\cap F).
$$
Using this, 
$$
P(F|E) = \frac{P(F\cap E)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(F)P(E)}{P(E)} = P(F).

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
A coin is tossed three times. What is the probability that exactly two heads
occur, given that
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> the first outcome was a head?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> the first outcome was a tail?
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b> the first two outcomes were heads?
<br /><br />
<b>(d)</b> the first two outcomes were tails?
<br /><br />
<b>(e)</b> the first outcome was a head and the third outcome was a head?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
Image below displays a helpful tree structure of all possible outcomes.
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
Let F be the event that the first toss is H, and note that P(F) = 1/2, and according to the tree structure below,
the new sample space will be the top half of the tree. Given this new information, we can log the new outcomes,
and the total number of Hs in parenthesis.
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
HH 1/8   (3)
HT 1/8   (2)
TH 1/8   (2)
TT 1/8   (1)
</pre>
We already have one H from the first toss F, so the probability of getting exactly two heads, an even we call H, is 1/2.
So P(F∩H) = 1/4. Calculating the conditional probability:
$$
P(H|F) = \frac{P(F\cap H)}{P(F)} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = 1/2.
$$
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
Let G be the event that we get T on the first toss, with P(G) = 1/2. The part of the tree we are restricted to, with number of Hs:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
HH 1/8   (2)
HT 1/8   (1)
TH 1/8   (1)
TT 1/8   (0)
</pre>
Now P(G∩H) = 1/8. Calculating the conditional probability:
$$
P(H|F) = \frac{P(F\cap H)}{P(F)} = \frac{1/8}{1/2} = 1/4.
$$
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b><br />
Let K be the event that the first two tosses are H, so P(K) = 1/4. The restricted tree:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
H 1/8   (3)
T 1/8   (2)
</pre>
Only one possible outcome has 2 Hs, P(K∩H) = 1/8.
$$
P(H|K) = \frac{P(H\cap K)}{P(K)} = \frac{1/8}{1/4} = 1/2.
$$
<br /><br />
<b>(d)</b><br />
Let M be the event that the first two tosses are T, so P(M) = 1/4. The restricted tree:
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
H 1/8   (1)
T 1/8   (0)
</pre>
Now no outcome has 2 Hs, P(M∩H) = 0. By independence P(M∩H) = P(M)P(H) = 0.
<br /><br />
<b>(e)</b><br />
A more tricky event, which we call L: first toss is a head, and the third toss is a head.
Reading from the tree, P(L) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4.
<br /><br />
Getting H or T in the second toss have equal probability, so divide the new sample space
into two parts each with probability 1/8. The only way to get exactly two H is if the second toss is T.
$$
P(H|L) = \frac{P(H\cap L)}{P(L)} = \frac{1/8}{1/4} = 1/2.

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
A die is rolled twice. What is the probability that the sum of the faces is
greater than 7, given that
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> the first outcome was a 4?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> the first outcome was greater than 3?
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b> the first outcome was a 1?
<br /><br />
<b>(d)</b> the first outcome was less than 5?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
Let S be the event that the sum of the die is greater than 7.
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
Event A: first roll is a 4. P(A) = 1/6. Restricted tree with sum of values in parenthesis.
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
1 1/36   (5)
2 1/36   (6)
3 1/36   (7)
4 1/36   (8)
5 1/36   (9)
6 1/36   (10)
</pre>
The probability that we get greater than 7 is P(A∩S) = 1/36 + 1/36 + 1/36 = 3/36 = 1/12.
$$
P(S|A) = \frac{P(S\cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{1/12}{1/6} = 1/2.
$$
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
Event B: first roll is greater than 3. P(B) = 1/2. Restricted tree with sum of values in parenthesis.
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
# 4
1 1/36   (5)
2 1/36   (6)
3 1/36   (7)
4 1/36   (8)
5 1/36   (9)
6 1/36   (10)

# 5
1 1/36   (6)
2 1/36   (7)
3 1/36   (8)
4 1/36   (9)
5 1/36   (10)
6 1/36   (11)

# 6
1 1/36   (7)
2 1/36   (8)
3 1/36   (9)
4 1/36   (10)
5 1/36   (11)
6 1/36   (12)
</pre>
Adding up all events that give a value greater than 7 gives us P(B∩S) = 12/36 = 1/3.
$$
P(S|A) = \frac{P(S\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{1/3}{1/2} = 2/3.
$$
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b><br />
Event C: first roll is a 1. P(C) = 1/6. Restricted tree with sum of values in parenthesis.
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
1 1/36   (2)
2 1/36   (3)
3 1/36   (4)
4 1/36   (5)
5 1/36   (6)
6 1/36   (7)
</pre>
No values are greater than 7. The probability then becomes P(C∩S) = P(C)P(S) = 0.
<br /><br />
<b>(d)</b><br />
Event D: first roll is smaller than 5, i.e. 1-4. P(D) = 2/3. Restricted tree with sum of values in parenthesis.
<pre style="font-family: monospace; background: #eee;">
# 1
1 1/36   (2)
2 1/36   (3)
3 1/36   (4)
4 1/36   (5)
5 1/36   (6)
6 1/36   (7)

# 2
1 1/36   (3)
2 1/36   (4)
3 1/36   (5)
4 1/36   (6)
5 1/36   (7)
6 1/36   (8)

# 3
1 1/36   (4)
2 1/36   (5)
3 1/36   (6)
4 1/36   (7)
5 1/36   (8)
6 1/36   (9)

# 4
1 1/36   (5)
2 1/36   (6)
3 1/36   (7)
4 1/36   (8)
5 1/36   (9)
6 1/36   (10)
</pre>
Counting all occurrences greater than 7 gives P(D∩S) = 6/36 = 1/6.
$$
P(S|D) = \frac{P(S\cap D)}{P(D)} = \frac{1/6}{2/3} = 1/4.

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
A card is drawn at random from a deck of cards. What is the probability that
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> it is a heart, given that it is red?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> it is higher than a 10, given that it is a heart? (Interpret J, Q, K, A as
11, 12, 13, 14.)
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b> it is a jack, given that it is red?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Informally!
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
P(Red) = 1/2. P(Heart ∩ Red) = 1/4 ==> P(Heart | Red) = 1/2.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
P(Heart) = 1/4. P(Greater than 10 ∩ Heart) = 4/52 ==> P(Gt10 | Heart) = 4/13.
<br /><br />
<b>(c)</b><br />
P(Red) = 1/2. P(Jack ∩ Red) = 1/13 ==> P(Jack | Red) = 2/13.

<h3>Exercise 5</h3>
A coin is tossed three times. Consider the following events
<br /><br />
A: Heads on the first toss.
<br /><br />
B: Tails on the second.
<br /><br />
C: Heads on the third toss.
<br /><br />
D: All three outcomes the same (HHH or TTT).
<br /><br />
E: Exactly one head turns up.
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> Which of the following pairs of these events are independent?
<div class="indent">
(1) A, B<br />
(2) A, D<br />
(3) A, E<br />
(4) D, E
</div>
<b>(b)</b> Which of the following triples of these events are independent?
<div class="indent">
(1) A, B, C<br />
(2) A, B, D<br />
(3) C, D, E
</div>
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
(1) A, B. Clearly <b>independent</b>, both have a probability of 1/2 and both happening has a probability of 1/4.
<br /><br />
(2) A, D. <b>Independent</b>!<br />
P(D) = P({HHH}) + P({TTT}) = 1/4. P(A) = P({HTT}) + P({HTH}) + P({HHT}) + P({HHH}) = 1/2.
So the intersection is, P(A∩D) = P({HHH}) = 1/8. And P(D|A) = P(A∩D)/P(A) = (1/8)/(1/2) = 1/4 which is equal to P(D).
<br /><br />
(3) A, E. Dependent. A is a subset of E.<br />
P(A) = 1/2. P(E) = P({HTT}) + P({THT}) + P({TTH}) = 3/8. The intersection becomes, P(A∩E) = P({HTT}) = 1/8.
And so, P(E|A) = P(A∩E)/P(A) = (1/8)/(1/2) = 1/4, so the conditional probability is changed.
<br /><br />
(4) D, E. Dependent.<br />
As shown before, P(D) = 2/8 and P(E) = 3/8.
<br /><br />
Writing out the sets.<br />
D = {HHH, TTT} and E = {HTT, THT, TTH}. The interscetion is empty, so P(D∩E) = P(∅) = 0 which is different from the
product; P(D)P(E) = (2/8)(3/8) = 6/64 = 3/32.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
Now we need to check that all pair of subsets are mutually independent.
<br /><br />
(1) A, B, C. We have already established that A and B are independent, so we have to check that A, C and B, C are independent.
But all these sets are obviously pairwise <b>independent</b> and since P(A∩B∩C) = 1/8 and P(A)P(B)P(C) = 1/8 so are A, B, C.
<br /><br />
(2) A, B, D. We have shown that A, B and A, D are independent, so we check if B, D are independent.
<br /><br />
P(D) = P({HHH}) + P({TTT}) = 1/4. P(B) = P({HTH}) + P({HTT}) + P({TTH}) + P({TTT}) = 1/2.
So the intersection is, P(B∩D) = P({TTT}) = 1/8. And P(D|B) = P(B∩D)/P(B) = (1/8)/(1/2) = 1/4 which is equal to P(D).
<br /><br />
Finally: P(A)P(B)P(D) = (1/2)(1/2)(1/4) = 1/16. and P(A∩B∩D) = P(∅) = 0. These probabilities are not equal, so A, B, D are not independent.
<br /><br />
(3) C, D, E. As shown earlier, D and E are dependent, so this is not independent.
<br /><br />

<h3>Exercise 6</h3>
From a deck of five cards numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively, a card
is drawn at random and replaced. This is done three times. What is the
probability that the card numbered 2 was drawn exactly two times, given
that the sum of the numbers on the three draws is 12?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
If we count all possible outcomes, we get a total of 5<sup>3</sup> = 125 possible draws, and each of them have
equal probability of 1/125.
<br /><br />
The possible ways of getting 12 with three cards are:<br />
{4, 4, 4}, 6 possible permutations of {6, 4, 2}, 3 possible permutations of {2, 2, 8}, which gives 10 possible outcomes.
So if we define the event T as getting 12, we get P(T) = 10/125 = 2/25.
<br /><br />
Out of these, there are 3 possible ways of getting 12 when we draw 2 twice. We define this outcome as Q, so P(Q) = 3/125.
Since Q is a subset of T, we get P(Q∩T) = 3/125. So,
$$
P(Q|T) = \frac{P(Q\cap T)}{P(T)} = \frac{3/125}{2/25} = 75/250 = 3/10 = 0.3.
$$

<h3>Exercise 7</h3>
A coin is tossed twice. Consider the following events.<br />
<b>A</b>: Heads on the first toss.<br />
<b>B</b>: Heads on the second toss.<br />
<b>C</b>: The two tosses come out the same.
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> Show that A, B, C are pairwise independent but not independent.<br />
<b>(b)</b> Show that C is independent of A and B but not of A ∩ B.<br />
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
The outcome for this problem: Ω = {HH, HT, TH, TT}, each with probability 1/4.<br />
A = {HT, HH} and P(A) = 1/2.<br />
B = {TH, HH} and P(B) = 1/2.<br />
C = {TT, HH} and P(C) = 1/2.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
So, A∩B = {HH} and P(A∩B) = 1/4, and P(A)P(B) = 1/4, so A, B are independent.
<br /><br />
A∩C = {HH} and P(A∩C) = 1/4, and P(A)P(C) = 1/4, so A, C are independent.
<br /><br />
B∩C = {HH} and P(B∩C) = 1/4, and P(B)P(C) = 1/4, so B, C are independent.
<br /><br />
However, A∩B∩C = {HH}, and P(A∩B∩C) = 1/4, but P(A)P(B)P(C) = 1/8, so all sets are pairwise independent, but
all three sets are not.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
As shown in (a), C is independent of A and B. The event A∩B = {HH} so P(A∩B) = 1/4.
We also get A∩B∩C = {HH} so P(A∩B∩C) = 1/4 and P(A∩B)P(C) = 1/8. Since these probabilities are not
equal, the events are not independent.
<br /><br />
<div class="exend">&#9632;</div>
<br /><br />






<h3>Exercise 8</h3>
Let Ω = {a, b, c, d, e, f}. Assume that m(a) = m(b) = 1/8 and m(c) =
m(d) = m(e) = m(f) = 3/16. Let A, B, and C be the events A = {d, e, a},
B = {c, e, a}, C = {c, d, a}. Show that P (A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A)P(B)P(C) but
no two of these events are independent.
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
First we calculate the set probabilities.<br />
P(A) = m(d) + m(e) + m(a) = 3/16 + 3/16 + 2/16 = 1/2<br />
P(B) = m(c) + m(e) + m(a) = 3/16 + 3/16 + 2/16 = 1/2<br />
P(C) = m(c) + m(d) + m(a) = 3/16 + 3/16 + 2/16 = 1/2.
<br /><br />
A ∩ B ∩ C = {a}  ==>  P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = 1/8. Also, P(A)P(B)P(C) = 1/8, so these probabilities are the same.
<br /><br />
Note that P(A)P(B) = 1/4. But A ∩ B = {e, a} and P(A ∩ B) = 5/16 - so A, B are note independent.<br />
The argument is exactly the same for A, C and B, C.

<h3>Exercise 9</h3>
What is the probability that a family of two children has<br />
(a) two boys given that it has at least one boy?<br />
(b) two boys given that the first child is a boy?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Assuming that the probability for B (boy) and G (girl) are both 1/2. The full outcome:<br />
Ω = {BB, BG, GB, GG}, each with probability 1/4.
<br /><br />
Let S be the event that the family has two boys. Let F be the event that the first is a boy,
and let E be the event that either child is a boy. Writing out the sets. (S; sons, F: first is boy, E: either is boy)
<br /><br />
S = {BB}, and P(S) = 1/4<br />
F = {BG, BB}, and P(F) = 1/2<br />
E = {GB, BB, BG}, and P(E) = 3/4<br />
<br /><br />
(a) We want to calculate P(S|E).
<br /><br />
S∩E = {BB}, so P(S∩E) = 1/4.
<br /><br />
P(S|E) = P(S∩E)/P(E) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 4/12 = 1/3.
<br /><br />
(b) We want to calculate P(S|F).
<br /><br />
S∩F = {BB}, so P(S∩F) = 1/4.
<br /><br />
P(S|F) = P(S∩F)/P(F) = (1/4)/(1/2) = 2/4 = 1/2.

<h3>Exercise 11</h3>
Simulate the Monty Hall problem. Carefully state any assumptions that you
have made when writing the program. Which version of the problem do you
think that you are simulating?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Do not make any particular assumptions? The winning door is a random sample from {1, 2, 3}. Then the initial door choice
is another random sample of {1, 2, 3}. Then there are two strategies the contestant can select: stay with the initial choice
or switch to another door. After simulating 1000 games, the winning rate for staying is roughly 1/3, and the win rate for
switching is roughly 2/3. (As described in the text, this simulation reflects the standard choice that Marilyin assumed).

<h3>Exercise 12</h3>
In Example 4.17, how large must the prior probability of cancer be to give a
posterior probability of .5 for cancer given a positive test?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Repeating the example here.
<br /><br />
    <div class="indent">
        <i>
        <b>Example 4.17</b> A doctor gives a patient a test for a particular cancer. Before the
        results of the test, the only evidence the doctor has to go on is that 1 woman
        in 1000 has this cancer. Experience has shown that, in 99 percent of the cases in
        which cancer is present, the test is positive; and in 95 percent of the cases in which
        it is not present, it is negative. If the test turns out to be positive, what probability
        should the doctor assign to the event that cancer is present? An alternative form
        of this question is to ask for the relative frequencies of false positives and cancers.
        We are given that prior(cancer) = .001 and prior(not cancer) = .999. We
        know also that P (+|cancer) = .99, P (−|cancer) = .01, P (+|not cancer) = .05,
        and P (−|not cancer) = .95. Using this data gives the result shown in Figure 4.5.
        We see now that the probability of cancer given a positive test has only increased
        from .001 to .019. While this is nearly a twenty-fold increase, the probability that
        the patient has the cancer is still small. Stated in another way, among the positive
        results, 98.1 percent are false positives, and 1.9 percent are cancers. When a group
        of second-year medical students was asked this question, over half of the students
        incorrectly guessed the probability to be greater than .5.
        </i>
    </div>
<br /><br />
Solving this numerically and finding that a prior(cancer) = 0.048 leads to a probability of 0.5.

<h3>Exercise 13</h3>
Two cards are drawn from a bridge deck. What is the probability that the
second card drawn is red?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Assuming this is a standard deck of cards.
<br /><br />
There are two cases that must be considered. The first card can either be black or red, each with 1/2 probability.
We define R as the event that the second card is red. A is the event that the first card is black, and B is the
event that the first card is red. Then P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
<br /><br />
If the first card is black, then P(R|A) = 26/51. If the first card is red, then P(R|B) = 25/51.
<br /><br />
By the law of total probability,<br />
P(R) = P(A)P(R|A) + P(B)P(R|B) = (1/2)(26/51) + (1/2)(25/51) = (51/102) = 0.5.

<h3>Exercise 14</h3>
If P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 1/4 and P(A|B) = 1/2, what is P(A ∩ B)?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
By law of complement, P(B) = 1 - P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 3/4.
<br /><br />
By definition of conditional probability,
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) = (1/2)(3/4) = 3/8.

<h3>Exercise 15</h3>
<b>(a)</b> What is the probability that your bridge partner has exactly two aces,
given that she has at least one ace?
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> What is the probability that your bridge partner has exactly two aces,
given that she has the ace of spades?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
In a game of bridge there are 4 players that each get 13 cards. So our partner has 13 cards, excluding our two opponents'
cards as well as our cards. As I later found out, I calculated the probability of having exactly two aces, given that you
have one ace. Let F be the event that the player gets one ace, and S the event that the player gets two aces.
<br /><br />
In this case, S is a subset of F, so P(F|S) = P(F∩S)/P(F) = P(S)/P(F).
$$
P(F) = \frac{\binom{4}{1}\binom{48}{12}}{\binom{52}{13}} \approx 0.43887
$$
$$
P(S) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}} \approx 0.2134
$$
So, P(S|F) = P(S)/P(F) ≈ 0.2134/0.43887 ≈ 0.4864.
<br /><br />
Instead, we want to find the probability of exactly two aces, given that the player has at least one ace.
Counting all possible draws of getting at least one ace: binom(52, 13) - binom(48, 13), i.e. all possible draws
minus all possible draws that don't contain any of the aces. Then for T: exactly two aces, the probability becomes:
$$
P(T) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13} - \binom{48}{13}} \approx 0.307.

<h3>Exercise 16</h3>
Prove that for any three events A, B, C, each having positive probability, and
with the property that P(A ∩ B) > 0,<br />
P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A ∩ B).
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Define Q = A ∩ B, so P(Q) = P(A ∩ B) > 0.
<br /><br />
By definition of conditional probability,<br />
P(C|Q) = P(Q ∩ C)/P(Q)  ==>  P(Q ∩ C) = P(Q)P(C|Q).<br />
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)  ==>  P(Q) = P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B|A).
<br /><br />
Then, using both of these,
$$
P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(Q\cap C) = P(Q)P(C|Q) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A\cap B).

Prove that if A and B are independent so are
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b> A and B<sup>c</sup>
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b> A<sup>c</sup> and B<sup>c</sup>
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
<br /><br />
By independence, P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). Also, by law of complements, P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 1 - P(B).
<br /><br />
<b>(a)</b><br />
\begin{align}
P(A) &= P(A\cap B) + P(A\cap B^c)
\\&\\
P(A\cap B^c) &= P(A) - P(A\cap B)
\\&\\
P(A\cap B^c) &= P(A) - P(A)P(B)
\\&\\
P(A\cap B^c) &= P(A)[1 - P(B)]
\\&\\
P(A\cap B^c) &= P(A)P(B^c),
\end{align}
which by Theorem 4.1 shows that A and B<sup>c</sup> are independent.
<br /><br />
<b>(b)</b><br />
We can apply the result from (a) to A<sup>c</sup> and B. Then,
\begin{align}
P(A^c) &= P(A^c\cap B) + P(A^c\cap B^c)
\\&\\
P(A^c\cap B^c) &= P(A^c) - P(A^c\cap B)
\\&\\
P(A^c\cap B^c) &= P(A^c) - P(A^c)P(B)
\\&\\
P(A^c\cap B^c) &= P(A^c)[1 - P(B)]
\\&\\
P(A^c\cap B^c) &= P(A^c)P(B^c),

<h3>Exercise 18</h3>
A doctor assumes that a patient has one of three diseases d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, or d<sub>3</sub>. Before
any test, he assumes an equal probability for each disease. He carries out a
test that will be positive with probability 0.8 if the patient has d<sub>1</sub>, 0.6 if he has
disease d<sub>2</sub>, and 0.4 if he has disease d<sub>3</sub>. Given that the outcome of the test was
positive, what probabilities should the doctor now assign to the three possible diseases?

<i>Answer</i><br />
Based on the information, we construct the following tree.<br />

<h3>Exercise 19</h3>
In a poker hand, John has a very strong hand and bets 5 dollars. The probability
that Mary has a better hand is 0.04. If Mary had a better hand she
would raise with probability 0.9, but with a poorer hand she would only raise
with probability 0.1. If Mary raises, what is the probability that she has a
better hand than John does?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
Let B be the event that Mary has a better hand than John. We know that P(B) = 0.04,
and then the probability that Mary has a worse hand is<br />
P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 1 - P(B) = 0.96.
<br /><br />
Next, we define R as the event that Mary raises. As given, P(R|B) = 0.9 and P(R|B<sup>c</sup>) = 0.1.
<br /><br />
We are going to calculate P(B|R). And for that we use Bayes' Theorem.
\begin{align}
P(B|R) &= \frac{P(R|B)P(B)}{P(R|B)P(B) + P(R|B^c)P(B^c)}
\\&\\
&= \frac{(0.9)(0.04)}{(0.9)(0.04) + (0.1)(0.96)}
\\&\\
&= \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.096}
\\&\\
&= \frac{0.036}{0.132}

&\approx 0.272727\ldots

<h3>Exercise 20</h3>
The Polya urn model for contagion is as follows: We start with an urn which
contains one white ball and one black ball. At each second we choose a ball
at random from the urn and replace this ball and add one more of the color
chosen. Write a program to simulate this model, and see if you can make
any predictions about the proportion of white balls in the urn after a large
number of draws. Is there a tendency to have a large fraction of balls of the
same color in the long run?
<br /><br />
<i>Answer</i><br />
It's impossible to make any predictions. Sometimes a very high proportion
of the balls are either white or black after 1000 draws, which all depends on
the outcome of the first draws. If by chance a lot of black balls are drawn,
it will be a self-perpetuating result to get more black etc.

<h3>Exercise 21</h3>
It is desired to find the probability that in a bridge deal each player receives an
ace. A student argues as follows. It does not matter where the first ace goes.
The second ace must go to one of the other three players and this occurs with
probability 3/4. Then the next must go to one of two, an event of probability
1/2, and finally the last ace must go to the player who does not have an ace.
This occurs with probability 1/4. The probability that all these events occur
is the product (3/4)(1/2)(1/4) = 3/32. Is this argument correct?
